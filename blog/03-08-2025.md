# 03/08/2025 - Image dataset

In order to train a YOLO model to detect playing cards (and which suit it is), I must gather many example images:
- The arm will sort playing cards by suit, so use the 10s because they have the most identifiable objects (e.g. hearts).
- Must be in the same conditions as the task will be carried out in to maximise performance, same lighting, same background, etc
- I aim to gather around 400 images, since the arm will be working in a controlled environment - the background will not change during detection
  
Then the next steps are:
- The images must be labelled, I'm using [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/)
 to achieve this
- Images must be split into training and validation sets
- Then I will train the model using an anaconda virtual environment, using a local GPU
