# 20/09/2025 - YOLO card detection

The card detection is complete. 

- The dataset contains 828 images of the four cards, with differing orientation, position, lighting and card count. There are also negative images to prevent false positives during deployment of the model. 
- The images were labelled using [Label Studio](https://labelstud.io/), shown below:

- The images were randomly split into 80% training and 20% validation. 
- I chose to use YOLO11n to optimise frame rate for use on a raspberry pi; a comparison of the different YOLO11 sub-models is shown below:

- I trained the model locally on an Nvidia RTX 3060Ti GPU, with 40 epochs, which is shown below:

- I wrote a python program to detect the cards in real time, and also combined the Aruco marker detection; a demo is shown below:
