# 02/08/2025 - Base completion

The base has been completed apart from the lid. The motors are mounted outside the turret, as an improvement on the previous version of the arm. It allows any NEMA 17 motor to be mounted without changing the design, and also allows easier access to the cables.

It features:
- Rotating turret to accommodate a counterweight
- Centering mechanism
- Timing belt driven rotation
- Belt tensioner
- NEMA 17 motors
- Limit switch for motor homing
